## Testing Locally

To test the game on your computer before deploying:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the game folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ivanu/birthday-puzzle-game
   ```

3. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

**Note:** The camera feature requires HTTPS when deployed online. GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS, so it will work fine there!

## Game Flow

1. **Welcome Screen** - Introduction and start button
2. **Photo Capture** - Takes a photo with 3-second countdown
3. **Clue 1-4** - Each clue requires the correct letter to proceed
4. **Code Entry** - Must arrange the 4 letters in the correct order
5. **Morse Code** - Final clue revealed in morse code, then decoded text appears

## Tips

- Test the game yourself first before the big day!
- Make sure your phone/device has camera permissions enabled
- Keep the correct answers written down somewhere safe
- The morse code will loop continuously and show the decoded message after 5 seconds

Happy Birthday to your wife! ðŸŽ‰
